/**
 * The ChatAppliation class serves as the Model (in the sense of the common user
 * interface design pattern known as Model-View-Controller) for the chat
 * application.
 * 
 * The ChatApplication inherits from the relatively little-known Android
 * application framework class Application. From the Android developers
 * reference on class Application:
 * 
 * Base class for those who need to maintain global application state. You can
 * provide your own implementation by specifying its name in your
 * AndroidManifest.xml's <application> tag, which will cause that class to be
 * instantiated for you when the process for your application/package is
 * created.
 * 
 * The important property of class Application is that its lifetime coincides
 * with the lifetime of the application, not its activities. Since we have
 * persistent state in our connections to the outside world via our AllJoyn
 * objects, and that state cannot be serialized, saved and restored; we need a
 * persistent object to ensure that state is held if transient objects like
 * Activities are destroyed and recreated by the Android application framework
 * during its normal operation.
 * 
 * This object holds the global state for our chat application, and starts the
 * Android Service that handles the background processing relating to our
 * AllJoyn connections.
 * 
 * Additionally, this class provides the Model for an MVC framework. It provides
 * a relatively abstract idea of what it is the application is doing. For
 * example, we provide methods oriented to conceptual actions (like our user has
 * typed a message) instead of methods oriented to the implementation (like,
 * create an AllJoyn bus object and register it). This allows the user interface
 * to be relatively independent of the channel implementation.
 * 
 * Android Activities can come and go in sometimes surprising ways during the
 * operation of an application. For example, when a phone is rotated from
 * portrait to landscape orientation, the displayed Activities are deleted and
 * recreated in the new orientation. This class holds the persistent state that
 * is required to correctly display Activities when they are recreated.
